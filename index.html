<a name="thickbox" class="anchor" href="#thickbox"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ThickBox</h1>

<p>ThickBox is a webpage UI dialog widget written in JavaScript on top of the jQuery library. Its function is to show a single image, multiple images, inline content, iframed content, or content served through AJAX in a hybrid modal.</p>

<p>It was developed by Cody Lindley and last updated to version 3.1 on 08/08/2007</p>

<p>This repository contains the ThickBox library as bower module for projects relying on the library</p>

<h2>
<a name="deprecation-warning" class="anchor" href="#deprecation-warning"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deprecation Warning</h2>

<p>It seems that the author of ThickBox doesn't have maintained the code for more than 7 years. It may and probably will have problems with recent versions of jQuery which drop legacy browser support.
Anyway ThickBox is still used. So if you really need it within your project and you do not want to download and maintain the library by yourself, you might want to use this bower component.</p>

<h2>
<a name="notice-about-readme" class="anchor" href="#notice-about-readme"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notice about README</h2>

<p>The README file contains the texts from the author's project website. It's taken and converted to markdown to have a reference beside the files you will find in the repository</p>

<h2>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>ThickBox was built using the super lightweight jQuery library. Compressed, the jQuery library is 20k, uncompressed it's 58k.</li>
<li>The ThickBox JavaScript code and CSS file only add an additional 15k (only 10k by using the thickbox-compressed.js) on top of the jQuery code. The CSS file could additionally be compressed if need be.</li>
<li>ThickBox will resize images that are bigger than the browser window.</li>
<li>ThickBox offers versatility (images, iframed content, inline content, and AJAX content).</li>
<li>ThickBox will hide form elements in Windows IE 6.</li>
<li>ThickBox will remain centered in the window even when the user scrolls the page or changes the size of the browser window. Clicking an image, the overlay, or close link will remove ThickBox.</li>
<li>Due to the ThickBox creator's view that transitions should be tailored by individual authors, ThickBox windows do not implement fancy transitions. Feel free to add them as you see fit. Is this a feature? Well, some might say it is.</li>
<li>ThickBox can be invoked from a link element, input element (typically a button), and the area element (image maps).</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>If you prefer to use the original library please visit <a href="http://codylindley.com/thickbox/">http://codylindley.com/thickbox/</a></p>

<p>Otherwise you may want to use bower to install the library to your project:</p>

<pre><code>bower install jquery-thickbox --save
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="integration" class="anchor" href="#integration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Integration</h2>

<p>ThickBox depends on jQuery. So you need to include jQuery <em>before</em> ThickBox into your website. The following example shows how it may be done.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-file/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-file/thickbox.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Paths may be different depending on your file structure. Because ThickBox is a bit aged yet, you should not expect that it will work with latest-greatest jQuery versions - but for now it works fine with jQuery 2.1.1.</p>

<p>You also must include the ThickBox CSS file into your website:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="path-to-file/thickbox.css" type="text/css" media="screen" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Please be aware that ThickBox uses a special PNG image (mayFFBgHack.png) which is referenced by the CSS file. ThickBox also uses a loading animation which basically is a animated GIF image with the name loadingAnimation.gif.</p>

<p>Depending on your file structure it might be necessary to update the path to this files.</p>

<a name="examples" class="anchor" href="#examples"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Examples</h2>

<h3>
<a name="single-image" class="anchor" href="#single-image"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Single Image</h3>

<p>This is the simplest example of ThickBox functionality. This example places a single image in a ThickBox.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a link element (<a href>)</a>
</li>
<li>Give the link a class attribute with a value of thickbox (class="thickbox")</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a path in the href attribute to an image file (.jpg .jpeg .png .gif .bmp)</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href="image1.jpg" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank" class="thickbox"&gt;&lt;img src="ithumbnail1.jpg" alt="Single Image"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="gallery-images" class="anchor" href="#gallery-images"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gallery Images</h3>

<p>This example is exactly like the single image functionality except that it allows use of the rel attribute to group images together so they can be navigated in a ThickBox. The ideal usage would be for images galleries.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create some link elements (<a href>)</a>
</li>
<li>Give the link a class attribute with a value of "thickbox" (class="thickbox")</li>
<li>Provide a path in the href attribute to an image file (.jpg .jpeg .png .gif .bmp)</li>
<li>Give each link element the same rel element and value. (Example: rel="gallery-plants")</li>
</ul><p>While you have a ThickBox gallery image open, you can navigate forward and backward through the images by using the left &lt; key (previous) and right &gt; key (next) on the keyboard (Next and Previous links are also provided in the ThickBox). The images will appear in the gallery from first to last as they appear in the HTML document flow.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="image1.jpg" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank" class="thickbox" rel="gallery-plants"&gt;&lt;img src="thumbnail1.jpg" alt="Plant 1" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="image2.jpg" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank" class="thickbox" rel="gallery-plants"&gt;&lt;img src="thumbnail2.jpg" alt="Plant 1" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="image3.jpg" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank" class="thickbox" rel="gallery-plants"&gt;&lt;img src="thumbnail3.jpg" alt="Plant 1" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="image4.jpg" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank" class="thickbox" rel="gallery-plants"&gt;&lt;img src="thumbnail4.jpg" alt="Plant 1" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="inline-content" class="anchor" href="#inline-content"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inline Content</h3>

<p>Inline content on the page, either hidden or showing, can be placed in a ThickBox.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a link element (<a href>)</a>
</li>
<li>Give the link a class attribute with a value of thickbox (class="thickbox")</li>
<li>In the href attribute of the link add the following anchor: #TB_inline</li>
<li>In the href attribute after the #TB_inline add the following query string on to the anchor: '?height=300&amp;width=300&amp;inlineId=myOnPageContent'</li>
<li>Change the values of height, width, and inlineId in the query accordingly (inlineID is the ID value of the element that contains the content you would like to show in a ThickBox.</li>
<li>Optionally you may add modal=true to the query string (e.g. #TB_inline?height=155&amp;width=300&amp;inlineId=hiddenModalContent&amp;modal=true) so that closing a ThickBox will require calling the tb_remove() function from within the ThickBox. See the hidden modal content example, where you must click yes or no to close the ThickBox.</li>
</ul><p>If the inline content in the ThickBox contains more content than the ThickBox dimensions will show, a vertical scroll bar will appear so that the content can be scrolled. You can avoid having the scroll by making sure the ThickBox has the appropriate dimensions in order to show all of the inline content without having to scroll. In other words, if you don't want scroll bars, increase the height and width of the ThickBox until the content does not require scrolling.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input alt="#TB_inline?height=300&amp;width=400&amp;inlineId=myOnPageContent" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank" class="thickbox" type="button" value="Show" /&gt;
&lt;a href="#TB_inline?height=155&amp;width=300&amp;inlineId=hiddenModalContent&amp;modal=true" class="thickbox"&gt;Show hidden modal content.&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="iframed-content" class="anchor" href="#iframed-content"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iFramed Content</h3>

<p>Opens URL's in an iframe inside of ThickBox. Yes, this is Greybox functionality.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a link element (<a href>)</a>
</li>
<li>Give the link a class attribute with a value of thickbox (class="thickbox")</li>
<li>In the href attribute of the link provide the URL you would like to display in a ThickBox</li>
<li>In the href attribute, after the URL, add the following query on to the end of the URL &amp; any parameters you might add: '?KeepThis=true&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;height=400&amp;width=600'</li>
<li>Change the values of height and width in the query accordingly</li>
<li>Optionally you may add modal=true to the query string (e.g. ?KeepThis=true&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;height=400&amp;width=600&amp;modal=true) so that closing a ThickBox will require calling the tb_remove() function from within the ThickBox iframe (self.parent.tb_remove()). See the iframe demo for an example, where you must click "ok" to close the ThickBox.</li>
</ul><p>Add all other query parameters before the TB_iframe parameters. Everything after the "TB" is removed from the URL.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="ajax.PHP?keepThis=true&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;height=250&amp;width=400" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank" class="thickbox"&gt;Example 1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="ajaxOverFlow.htm?keepThis=true&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;height=300&amp;width=500" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank" class="thickbox"&gt;Example 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="iframeModal.html?placeValuesBeforeTB_=savedValues&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;height=200&amp;width=300&amp;modal=true" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank" class="thickbox"&gt;Open iFrame Modal&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="ajax-content" class="anchor" href="#ajax-content"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AJAX Content</h3>

<p>Use a hidden HTTP request (AJAX) to fetch files from the same server and have ThickBox display the contents of the files.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a link element (<a href>)</a>
</li>
<li>Give the link a class attribute with a value of thickbox (class="thickbox")</li>
<li>Provide a path in the href to the file/directory on the server. (href="ajaxLogin.htm")</li>
<li>In the href attribute, after the URL path to the file, add the following query on to the end of the URL: '?height=300&amp;width=300'</li>
<li>Change the values of height and width in the query accordingly</li>
<li>Optionally you may add modal=true to the query string (e.g. ?height=300&amp;width=300&amp;modal=true) so that closing a ThickBox will require calling the tb_remove() function from within the ThickBox. See the login example, where you must click cancel to close the ThickBox.</li>
</ul><p>In order to open new Ajax content in an open Ajax ThickBox, its code must also contain the appropriate HTML (class=""thickbox) to launch an Ajax ThickBox (see demo for example). The only catch is, the ThickBox calls must include both the width and height of the original ThickBox. If you leave it blank the window will resize to the default size(630x440).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="ajaxOverFlow.html?height=300&amp;width=300" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank" class="thickbox"&gt;Scrolling content&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="ajax.PHP?height=220&amp;width=400" class="thickbox" title="add a caption to title attribute / or leave blank"&gt;No-scroll content&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="ajaxLogin.html?height=85&amp;width=250&amp;modal=true" class="thickbox" title="Please Sign In"&gt;login (modal)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="ajaxTBcontent.html?height=200&amp;width=300" class="thickbox" title=""&gt;Update ThickBox content&lt;/a&gt;

<p>I suggest stripping out the old CSS and JS and adding back in the new code created for the current version of ThickBox. If that is bad news, then hold tight - I have some good news, too. The way by which ThickBox is invoked has not changed. So, there is no need to change the HTML that invokes a ThickBox.</p>

<h3>

<p>In short, yes! However, I have not personally tested this yet. I have no idea of the browser quirks and support surrounding the usage of Flash in a ThickBox.</p>

<p>Sort of, using an Ajax ThickBox you can update the content of the ThickBox. See the Ajax Demo Example.</p>

<p>The short of it is, yes! In fact, anything that can be viewed in a browser can also be viewed in a ThickBox using an iframe. Check out the iframe content example.</p>

<a name="support" class="anchor" href="#support"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support</h2>

<p>ThickBox has received more attention than I had initially expected - so much so that I am a little overwhelmed with the notoriety and somewhat dumbfounded by all the individuals using it. Truthfully, I developed the solution as a proof of concept and personal endeavor to showcase the jQuery library. With that said, I think I might owe some people an apology. ThickBox is not retail software. It has no support or documentation (except for this site). Itâ€<g-emoji alias="tm" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2122.png">™</g-emoji>s the start of a great script and should be used as a launching point. If you see its potential, then the script was likely created for you. If, however, you only see the limitations of the solution, then honestly, the script is likely not for you. With that said, I am sorry that I do not have the time to respond to every email/comment requesting support. However, if you send a detailed email of the issue, along with the browser(s) and operating system(s) the issue is occurring in, the chances of getting direct support will increase significantly. In addition to emailing me directory, and the choice for support I would recommend, you can visit and pillaged the ThickBox Forum for peer support.</p>

<p>If past development is any indication, ThickBox will likely morph into another version in the future. If at that point it can stand alone as useful to you, then use it. However, as of today please do not expect a great deal of support for a script that was really never meant to be a complete software solution. Remember, this stuff is free. If it so happens to come wrapped with great documentation and support, then even better, but please don't assume that it should.</p>

<h2>
<a name="donate" class="anchor" href="#donate"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Donate</h2>

<p>Knowledge is its own reward. While its true that my own personal enjoyment and education continues to thrive as I develop ThickBox, a little bit of cash for a rainy day never hurt anyone. So, if you're feeling gracious and would like to improve my monetary situation out of gratitude, or maybe because my work on ThickBox has helped you monetarily, you can give me a little cash for all my hard work by clicking on the "PayPal Donate" button below and send me some cha-ching. Of course, this is not necessary, even if you plan on using ThickBox commercially. As I said, knowledge is its own reward.</p>
